# Audio 3D tester

This is a simple audio stereo manipulator in order to test some HRTF Kemar studies.

My goal was to reproduce a small spatialization sensation avoiding machine learning and pre-trained situations.

Playing with some of the variables like delay, panning and decay it\'92s possible to achieve a small sensation of positioning of the audio source.\

But in the end the mechanism is too fragile too be considered a valid one.\

## Future possibilities

A possible future integration could be the integration of filters in order to reproduce the IIR of the ear\'92s pinna.}
